A set of standards for electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the European Single Market.\n**Provider** | Represents the ASPSP. A bank or financial institution that offer payment accounts with online access.\n**PSD2** | The Second Revised Payment Services Directive. The directive of the European Parliament and of the Council of the European Union which requires ﬁnancial institutions within the European Economic Area to provide access to their customers' accounts (XS2A), to Third Party Providers to provide account information and payment initiation services.\n**PSU** | Payment Service User. Natural or legal person making use of a payment service as a payee, payer or both.\n**PISP** | Payment Initiation Service Provider. Provides an online service to initiate a payment order at the request of the payment service user with respect to a payment account held at another payment service provider.\n**PIISP** | Payment Issuer Instrument Service Provider.

TPPs include PISPs, AISPs, and PIISPs.\n**XS2A** | Access to Account. The provision of secure access to accounts operated by ASPSPs using APIs.\n\n### Scopes Definition\n\nType | Description\n---------|----------\n**accounts** | grants TPP access to Customer's accounts data\n**transactions** | grants TPP access to transactions which belong to Customer's account\n**balances** | grants TPP access to Customer's balances data\n\n## Registration Endpoint\n\nEndpoint | Verb | Purpose\n---------|----------|----------\n/api/v1/tpps | **POST** | Used for registration in Salt Edge PSD2 Compliance Dashboard. After registration, you will receive a letter of confirmation on your representative email.\n\n## API Endpoints\n\nEndpoint | Verb | Purpose\n---------|----------|----------\n/api/v1/oauth/tokens | **POST** | Generate access and refresh tokens.\n/api/v1/consents | **POST** | This method creates a consent resource, defining access rights to dedicated accounts of a given `PSU-ID`. These accounts are addressed explicitly in the method as parameters as a core function.\n/api/v1/consents/{consent_id} | **GET** | Returns the content of an account information consent object. This returns the data for the TPP especially in cases, where the consent was directly managed between ASPSP and PSU e.g. in a redirect SCA Approach.\n/api/v1/consents/{consent_id}/status\t| **GET** | Read the status of an account information consent resource.\n/api/v1/consents/{consent_id} | **DELETE** | This method deletes a consent.\n/api/v1/accounts | **GET** | \tRead the identifiers of the available payment account together with booking balance information, depending on the consent granted. It is assumed that a consent of the PSU to this access is already given and stored on the ASPSP system. The addressed list of accounts depends on the PSU ID and the stored consent addressed by consentId. Returns all identifiers of the accounts, to which an account access has been granted to through the `/consents` endpoint by the PSU. In addition, relevant information about the accounts and hyperlinks to corresponding account information resources are provided if a related consent has been already granted. **Remark**: Note that the `/consents` endpoint optionally offers to grant an access on all available payment accounts of a PSU. In this case, this endpoint will deliver the information about all available payment accounts of the PSU at this ASPSP.\n/api/v1/refresh/consents/{consent_id} | **PUT** | This endpoint is responsible for starting the process of refreshing account information data on Bit PSD2 side. Due to asynchronous nature of this action, TPP has to poll the status of this process untill receive the status failed or finished\n/api/v1/refresh/consents/{consent_id} | **GET** | This endpoint is responsible for returning the current status of fetching account information process.\n/api/v1/accounts/{account_id} | **GET** | Reads details about an account, with balances where required. It is assumed that a consent of the PSU to this access is already given and stored on the ASPSP system. The addressed details of this account depends on the stored consent addressed by `consentId`.\n/api/v1/accounts/{account_id}/transactions\t| **GET** | Read transaction reports or transaction lists of a given account addressed by `account_id`, depending on the steering parameter `bookingStatus` together with balances.\n/api/v1/accounts/{account_id}/transactions/{transaction_id}\t| **GET** | Reads transaction data from a given account and transaction addressed by `account_id` and `transaction_id`.\n/api/v1/accounts/{account_id}/balances\t| **GET** | Reads account data from a given account addressed by `account_id`.\n\n## All Errors\n\nDuring any request or flow originating either on TPP or Salt Edge PSD2 Compliance side, a number of errors may appear. In order to standardize errors while still giving some degree of freedom in explaining an error callback, parameters should include both `error_text` and `error_code`. Error message serves the purpose of communicating the issue to the Customer, whereas error class should be used by TPPs in order to be able to handle various scenarios.\n\nContents of the error_code are entirely up to the Provider, they may even be localized. However, values sent within `error_text` parameter should be from the standardized list. This list may and will be extended over time.\n\nClass | Code | Description\n---------|----------|----------\n**FormatError** | 400 | Invalid input. More info in `error_message`.\n**DigestInvalid** | 400 | Header 'Digest' invalid.\n**SignatureInvalid** | 400 | Given signature is invalid.\n**SignatureMissing** | 400 | This request cannot be performed without Signature header.\n**SignatureMalformed** | 400 | Given signature is malformed.\n**CertificateInvalid** | 401 | Given certificate is invalid.\n**ConsentStatusForbidden** | 403 | Consent is not valid.\n**AccessDenied** | 403 | The resource owner or authorization server denied the request.\n**TppNotFound** | 404 | Requested TPP cannot be found.\n**ConsentNotFound** | 404 | Requested consent cannot be found.\n**AccountNotFound** | 404 | Requested account cannot be found.\n**TransactionNotFound** | 404 | Requested transaction cannot be found.\n**RouteNotFound** | 404 | Requested url does not exist.\n\n## Useful Links and Contact Information\n\nYou can find below the following useful links and assistance channel:\n\n1. You can find the full documentation for the [BOI NextGenPSD2 Implementation Guidelines](https://www.boi.org.il/roles/supervisionregulation/bank-sup/open-banking/) on the official BOI website.\n\n2. In case you have any questions on integration with this dedicated interface please contact us at:\ncompliance@saltedge.com or use the Help Desk from TPP Dashboard.\n\n## Account Information Flow\n\n1. Request consent from the Bank BIT account's owner to share with you information on one or more of their accounts.\n2. **Customer Authentication and Customer consent approval**: Consent is created once the bank's customer authenticates himself on the Bank BIT login page and explicitly approves the consent sent by you to a dedicated screen.\nChanging the user's password during the customer consent process, is not applicable.\n**When the customer is authenticated and the consent is approved, you will receive an authorisation code, which must be immediately replaced with an Access Token.**\n3. **Retrieve account information**: You can retrieve the bank customer's account data as long as the consent is valid and has not expired, and by providing the valid Access Token.\n4. **Consent Renewal**. If the consent has expired or been revoked for any reason, your customer can give you a new consent.\n\n## Consent statuses\n\n|Description|Berlingroup Status|\n|---|---|\n|The consent data have been received and are technically correct.<br>The data is not authorised yet.|received|\n|The consent data have been rejected e.g. since no successful<br>authorisation has taken place.|rejected|\n|The consent is accepted and valid for GET account data calls<br>and others as specified in the consent object.|valid|\n|The consent expired.| expired |\n|The consent has been revoked by the PSU towards the ASPSP.| revokedByPsu |\n|The corresponding TPP has terminated the consent by<br>applying the DELETE method to the consent resource.| terminatedByTpp|\n|The consent has been suspended by the ASPSP, according<br>to requirements that are detailed in BoI's directive.| suspendedByASPSP |\n\n\n## Payment statuses\n\n|Description|Berlingroup Status|\n|---|---|\n|Payment initiation or individual transaction included in the payment<br>initiationis pending.

Ordered expired within 3 days payment<br>initiation hasbeen rejected.| EXPD |\n|Payment initiation has been cancelled before execution.| CANC |\n\n\n# Authorization Security\n\n## OAuth2 URLs\n\n\nURL | Description\n---------|----------\n `https://www.bitpay.co.il/app/open-banking` | Authorization URL\n `https://open-banking.bitpay.co.il/api/v1/oauth/token` | Token URL\n `https://open-banking.bitpay.co.il/api/v1/oauth/token` | Token Refresh URL\n\n> In accordance with the relevant RFCs, the token and token revocation URLs will only accept a content type of `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`. JSON content is not permitted and will return an error.\n\n## OAuth2 Scopes\n\nName | Description\n---------|----------\n `AIS:{consentId}` | Allows to consume the resources referenced to Consent with specified `Id`\n  `PIS:{paymentId}` | Allows to consume the resources referenced to Payment with specified `Id`\n\n## State and Security\n\nBefore we dive into the semantics of the different OAuth2 grants, we should stop and discuss security, specifically the use of the state parameter. Cross-site request forgery, or CSRF, and Clickjacking are security vulnerabilities that must be addressed by individuals implementing OAuth. This is typically accomplished using the state parameter. state is sent in the authorization request and returned back in the response and should be a value that binds the user's request to their authenticated state. For example, state could be a hash of the user's session cookie, or some other nonce that can be linked to the user's session.\n\nWhen a user begins an authorization flow on the client, a state is generated that is unique to that user's request. This value is stored somewhere only accessible to the client and the user, i.e. protected by the same-origin policy. When the user is redirected, the state parameter is returned. The client validates the request by checking that the state returned matches the stored value. If they match, it is a valid authorization request. If they do not match, it's possible that someone intercepted the request or otherwise falsely authorized themselves to another user's resources, and the request should be denied.\n\n## Authorization Code Grant\n\nThe authorization code grant is what most developers will recognize as \"standard OAuth2\" and involves retrieving an access code and exchanging it for a user's access token. It allows the authorization server to act as an intermediary between the client and the resource owner, so the resource owner's credentials are never shared directly with the client.\n\n## PKCE\n\nPKCE modifies the standard authorization code grant. Before starting the authorization code grant, a random string called `code_verifier` is generated using the characters: `[A-Z], [a-z], [0-9], \"-\", \".\", \"_\"` and `\"~\"`, with a minimum length of 43 characters and a maximum length of 128 characters. Additionally to the `code_verifier` a `code_challenge` is created. We supports `code_challenge_method` `S256` the code_challenge is the SHA256 Hash value of the code_verifier url safe base64 encoded (without trailing \"=\" compare to: [https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636#appendix-A](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636#appendix-A))\n\n\n## Authorization URL Example\n\n```\nhttps://www.bitpay.co.il/app/open-banking?response_type=code&client_id=org-identifier-123456&scope=AIS:2345&state=15773059ghq9183habn&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Ftpp.website&code_challenge=XEuwH6eFPlLDoVB7vL3KpC6T3WYaEGDyXGb7tpNJCZA&code_challenge_method=S256\n\n```\n\n`client_id` is TPP's organization identifier.`scope` is a scope specified in [OAuth2 Scopes](#section/Authorization-Security/OAuth2-Scopes). `redirect_uri` is whatever URL you registered when creating your application, url-encoded. `state` is the unique string mentioned in [State and Security](#section/Authorization-Security/State-and-Security). `code_challenge` and `code_challenge_method` described in [PKCE](#section/Authorization-Security/PKCE)\n\n## Redirect URL Example\n\n```\nhttps://tpp.website/?code=NhhvTDYsFcdgNLnnLijcl7Ku7bEEeee&state=15773059ghq9183habn\n```\n\n`code` is now exchanged for the user's access token by making a POST request to the [Token URL](#tag/OAuth2/operation/post-api-oauth-tokens)\n\n## Signature Headers\n\n#### Instruction to create BerlinGroup Signature\n\nTo register as a TPP, the first thing you must do is get a valid EIDAS certificate.<br>\nThe required headers for this call are:\n\n- `X-Request-ID`: [A Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID) URN Namespace](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4122)\n  - example: `79c851ce-f543-4c27-a8e4-f9aad20724ba`\n- `Digest`: Base64 request body encoded SHA256\n  - Example:\n\n  ```bash\n  > export BODY=\"{}\"\n  > echo -n $BODY | openssl sha256 -binary | base64\n  RBNvo1WzZ4oRRq0W9+hknpT7T8If536DEMBg9hyq/4o=\n  # Digest value: \"SHA-256=RBNvo1WzZ4oRRq0W9+hknpT7T8If536DEMBg9hyq/4o=\"\n  ```\n- `Date`: [Date/Time Format](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7231#section-7.1.1.1)\n  - Example: `Fri, 04 Feb 2022 17:16:59 GMT`\n- `TPP-Signature-Certificate`: Base64 strict encoded certificate in PEM format.\n  - Example:\n\n  ```bash\n  > export PEM=\"-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\\nMB0wFgIBADAAMAAwBB8AHwAwADAFMAADAQAwAAMBAA==\\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----\\n\"\n  > echo -n $PEM | base64\n  LS0tLS1CRUdJTiBDRVJUSUZJQ0FURS0tLS0tCk1CMHdGZ0lCQURBQU1BQXdCQjhBSHdBd0FEQUZNQUFEQVFBd0FBTUJBQT09Ci0tLS0tRU5EIENFUlRJRklDQVRFLS0tLS0K\n  ```\n\n- `Signature`: Is the signed value of the message, and has the following regexp structure:\n\n  ```bash\n  /keyId=\\\"SN=(?<serial>.+),CA=(?<ca>.+)\\\",algorithm=\\\"(?<algorithm>.+)\\\",headers=\\\"(?<headers>.+)\\\",signature=\\\"(?<signature>.+)\\\"/\n  ```\n\n  - `keyId` that must be formatted as `SN={serial},CA={issuer}`\n  - `algorithm` could be (`\"rsa-sha-256\"` or `\"rsa-sha-512\"`)\n  - `headers`.<br>Create a string to be using a set of request headers: `digest`, `x-request-id`, `psu-id`, `psu-corporate-id` and `tpp-redirect-uri` in this example, we will just use the mandatory ones: `x-request-id` and `digest`, the final result will be: `\"x-request-id digest\"`\n  - `signature`<br>Create a string to be signed built using a set of request headers: `digest`, `x-request-id`, `psu-id`, `psu-corporate-id` and `tpp-redirect-uri` in this example, we will just use the mandatory ones: `x-request-id` and`digest`, the final result will be: `\"digest x-request-id\"`.<br>Here the order of these fields in the signing string matters and they need to be on separate lines.

These accounts are addressed explicitly in the method as parameters as a core function.\n\n**Consent access details**\n\nConsent can be one of the following models:\n\n- **Bank offered** - with bank driven account selection and possible restriction to account types \n- **Detailed** - with pre-selected accounts on TPP side\n\n*Bank offered consent*\n\nThe bank offered consent model would allow for PSU to select accounts to be shared with TPP on ASPSP side after authentication, while TPP shall pre-define only the permissions (accounts, balances, transactions) required to provide service. In this case, access remains empty until the SCA process is finalized and the consent status changes to ‘valid’. Both structures exhibit similar behavior. Both structures exhibit similar behavior.\n\nStructure example 1:\n\n```json\n { // Access to accounts, balances, transactions data  \n  \"access\": {\n    \"accounts\": [],\n    \"transactions\": [],\n    \"balances\": []\n  }\n}\n```\nStructure example 2:\n\n```json\n { // Access to accounts and balances data (accounts access automatically included)\n  \"access\":  {\n    \"balances\": []\n  }\n}\n```\n\n*Bank offered consent with restrictions*\n\nIn case the TPP wants PSU to select accounts on the ASPSP side, but for this specific TPP service the consent shall be restricted to the specific account type.\n\nStructure example:\n\n```json\n{ // Consent restricted to savings account(s) selected by PSU \n  \"access\": {\n    \"accounts\": [],\n    \"transactions\": [],\n    \"balances\": [],\n    \"restrictedTo\": [\"SVGS\"] \n  }\n}\n```\n\n**NOTE**: The `restrictedTo` attribute appears only in the **POST** `/consents` request body. According to the Berlin Group standard, this attribute should not appear in the response of **POST** `/consents` or **GET** `/consents`\n\n\n*Detailed consent (pre-selected accounts)*\n\nThe detailed consent model presumes for PSU to grant access to the specific accounts allowed the TPP to fetch. For this, the PSU selects accounts from a pre-saved list in TPP application or provides account(s) details directly in the TPP application before redirection for authentication. In this case, the ASPSP should validate and allow access only to the requested information in the consent details, with a set of applicable data permissions (accounts, balances, transactions).\n\nStructure example:\n\n```json\n {\n  \"access\": { \n    \"accounts\": [\n      { // Account information of the following payment account only in USD currency\n        \"bban\": \"5411241\",\n        \"currency\": \"USD\",\n        \"cashAccountType\": \"CACC\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"transactions\": [\n      { // Transactions and account info of the following savings account\n        \"bban\": \"5411241\",\n        \"cashAccountType\": \"SVGS\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"balances\": [\n      { // ILS balance and account info of the following payment account \n        \"bban\": \"123123\",\n        \"currency\": \"ILS\",\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n",
